## Bot-Battlr

Welcome to **Bot Battlr**, the one and only spot in the known universe where you
can custom build your own Bot Army.

### Description

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a list 
of available bots, among other features. Try your best to find the right places to 
insert code into the established code base.
Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for setting up the application.

### Project Setup

1. Run npm install in your terminal.
2. Run npm run server. This will run your backend on port 8002.
3. In a new terminal, run npm start. This will run your React app on port 8000.
4. Make sure to open http://localhost:8002/bots in the browser to verify that your  backend is working before you proceed!
5. The base URL for your backend is: http://localhost:8002

### Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `YourBotArmy` component.
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.

### Advanced Deliverables

These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have
the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to
stretch your skills.

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure to have a working project, and commit all the Core Deliverables first!
> As a user, I should be able to:

- Choose if I want to enlist a bot into my army or just see their data. Clicking
  on the card should instead display a show view (`BotSpecs`) for that bot,
  which should replace `BotsCollection`. BotSpecs should have two buttons: one
  to go back to the list view and another to enlist that bot.
  - Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component,
    `SortBar`.
- When I enlist a bot it will be **removed** from the `BotCollection` and added
  to `YourBotArmy`.
- Filter bots by their class. We can select a few filters at the same time.
- Sort bots by their health, damage or armor. For this, create a new component,
  `SortBar`.
- Only enlist **one** bot from each `bot_class`. The classes are
  `["Support", "Medic", "Assault", "Defender", "Captain", "Witch"]`.
